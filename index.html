  <h1 style="color: orange;"> HOW TO MAKE TEA</h1>     
        <img src="bildeavtea.jpg" alt="man whith tea" width="30%" height="30%" >
        <p>At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough <br>
             fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have <br>
              shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart</p>

              <h2 style="color: orange;" >INGREDIENTS</h2> 

            
<ul> 
 <li>tea bag</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional)</li>
<li>Sugar/Honey (Optional)</li>

</ul>
<h2 style="color: orange;" >PREPARATION</h2>
<ol {float:center;} >
<li>Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and <br>
     only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen <br>
      in water helps flavour!</li>
      <li>pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)</li>
      <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
      <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 <br>
           minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a <br>
            sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</li>
            <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a <br>
                 spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or <br>
                  you'll make it bitter.</li>
                  <li>If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or <br>
                       nothing else at all.</li>
                       <li>Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
